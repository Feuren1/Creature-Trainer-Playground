# TODO BEFORE PROD
- Create env variables for different modes ( PRODUCTION, ENV, DEV etc..)
    -> Use them to handle different routings and stuff


# NEXT STEPS:
- Setup Routing for the frontend 
- Create MainMenu, move main.js to battle.js, create Room menu

# TODO Next: Implement ORM? Queries would be way too complex, or the database would be too simple
